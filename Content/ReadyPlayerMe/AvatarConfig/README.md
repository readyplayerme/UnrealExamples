# Avatar Config Map

The AvatarConfigMap map located in the `Content > ReadyPlayerMe > AvatarConfig > Maps` folder, it contains a simple logic of adding the **WBP_AvatarConfigSetup** widget to the viewport and updating the preview avatar when the config is changed.

# Avatar Config Setup Widget

Inside of the **WBP_AvatarConfigSetup** you can find the parameters that exist in avatar config. You can change the parameters and see how the resulting avatar looks for you.
After you tweak the params and found an ideal result for you, you can create your own avatar config by duplicating the **DA_RPM_AvatarConfig** file and modifying it.
